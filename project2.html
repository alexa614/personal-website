    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">Description: <br></span>This iOS app (programmed using Swift, ARKit, and SceneKit) gives players 20 seconds to shoot as many moving targets as possible by aiming their phone and firing. There are three levels (each with different speed targets) and five unique powerups to make the game more engaging. Additionally, each player's previous and high score is saved and displayed for each level.</p>
    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">Inspiration: <br></span>I got the idea for this project when I first saw the Apple Vision Pro. I think augmented reality is interesting, and I wanted to try it out by making a fun game.</p>
    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">What I Learned: <br></span>While developing this project, I got better at learning how to use new libraries quickly. I also significantly improved my debugging skills because I had a lot of issues in the beginning with the physics of the game not working how I wanted it to.</p>
