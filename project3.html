    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">Description: <br></span>This website (made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript) allows players to pick a height and width for a maze. It generates the requested maze, which the player can solve using the arrow keys. There is also a two-player version where players can race to complete their mazes.</p>
    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">Inspiration: <br></span>I had the idea for this game in class while learning about the time complexity of algorithms. I wanted to create an original algorithm and try to make it as efficient as possible. I developed an algorithm that generates a maze of any size with exactly one solution and no loops. My algorithm does this in O(height*width) time.</p>
    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">What I Learned: <br></span>This project helped me learn about algorithms and optimizing their time complexity. I also improved my JavaScript skills. </p>
