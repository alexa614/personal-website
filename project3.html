    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">Description: <br></span>This website (made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript) allows players to pick a height and a width of a maze. This maze is generated and the player can use the arrow keys to solve it. There is also a two player versions where players can race to complete their mazes.</p>
    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">Inspiration: <br></span>I had the idea for this game while sitting in class learning about the time complexity of algoithms. I wanted to create my own algorithm and try to make it as efficient as possible, and I decided to do that by creating an algorithm that creates an array representing a maze of any size with exactly one solution and no loops. My algorithm does this in O(length*width) time.</p>
    <p class="response"><span class="prompt">What I Learned: <br></span>This project helped me learn about algorithms and optimizing their time complexity. I also improved my JavaScript skills. </p>
